Create (progressive) React app on Heroku

React router is for having different urls on one app without having to reload the app.
Web API built into browser to allow to do this (updates address bar)

Progressive allows us to cache on client's local storage. Can also add to homescreen to open app in the browser (all already downloaded)

Some projects on Github for React progressive apps

1 Creat a normal React app
2 Make it offline


TODO
Make templatetag to get latest bundle from assets/build/static/js it has dynamic filename. Use this in index.html
Setup react router urls for react app

When developing react app, run npm start on one terminal to run the dev version of react app, and run django runserver from a different terminal to make the api available
